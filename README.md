# AI-Powered Blog Content Summarizer

Build a web application where users can paste or upload blog articles, and the app generates concise summaries using an AI-based text summarization API. The frontend allows users to input articles, view summaries, track their summary history, and organize them with tags. The backend manages user sessions, stores summarized articles, and integrates with an NLP summarization model or external API (e.g., OpenAI). The UI is clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly, using Tailwind CSS.
